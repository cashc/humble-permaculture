# Humble Permaculture Design

<div class="section-header">
  What is Permaculture? 
</div>
I define it as a design framework to create regenerative, sustainable habitat for all of life- both human and non-human. With minimal human intervention by utilizing Earth's existing systems. In short, it's working *with* nature.

<div class="section-header">
  Why "humble"?
</div>
I grew up in a society that is in my opinion mostly disconnected from nature. Never thinking of it or thinking of it only as "natural resources", and certainly not thinking of it as an extension of one's self or family. Growing up in this way has caused me to believe that humility is of utmost importance when interacting with nature today. It is the counter to the feeling of supremacy we humans have had over it for the past couple hundred years, and the antidote to thinking are more intelligent than it.

In our recent past, we humans have widely held the belief that we are superior; we have a right to conquer, extract, and consume. This false sense of superiority is not only wrong, it's detrimental to ourselves and all of life. Our assumed right to extract and consume is being questioned now as we are realizing the repercussions of our impact. Our eyes are being opened to the interconnectedness of nature, the importance of slowing down, asking questions, and listening with reverence to our elder relatives (all of life) as they teach us how to to live in harmony and behave like humans once again. In order for us humans to return to the role of keystone species on the planet, we must first practice humility and accept that we are not greater than the salmon, the beaver, or the trees- in fact, they have much to teach us.

It is with this humble reverence for all of life that I conduct my work.
