### Permaculture design consultations

Why "humble"? I believe humility is of utmost importance in our world today. In our recent past, us humans widely held belief has been one of superiority and right to conquer all other life. An assumed right to extract and consume. This way of thinking is coming to an end as now we are realizing the repercussions of our impact on the Earth. Our eyes are being opened to the interconnectedness of nature, the importance of slowing down, asking questions, and listening with reverence as our elder relatives (all of life) teach us how to be human and live in harmony once again. In order to return us humans to the role of keystone species on the planet, we must first practice humility and accept that we are not greater than the salmon, the beaver, or the trees- in fact, they have much to teach us.

It is with this humble reverence for all of life that I conduct my work.

If you're interested in working together, please send me an email at cashscompton@gmail.com with your address or GPS coordiantes, a little about your property and your relationship with it, and a little about yourself and your goals for the land.

Thank you!
