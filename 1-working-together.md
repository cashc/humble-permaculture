As my client, I will not work for you but rather we will work together. I may offer many ideas and creative solutions but at the end of the day, we are creating your design.

Everything I offer is free. As such, I am very selective about which clients I work with. The things I consider when choosing projects are:
- Amount of time and energy you are willing to spend observing and interacting with your land
- Current state of the land versus its capacity
- Community impact

If you're interested in working together, please fill out the form below. I look forward to hearing from you and please don't hesitate to fill out the form even if you're not sure you want to work with me as it's a valuable exercise and important first step in the design process no matter where you choose to go from here.

_Form coming soon..._
- a little about yourself
- your relationship with your property
- how your project aligns with my selection criteria as outlined above.
